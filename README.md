# What's Siru?
[Siru](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dotsillustration.siru) is an icon pack for Android that I designed and developed along with [Laureano Ruiz](https://github.com/laureanoruiz), using [Blueprint](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/Blueprint) by [Jahir Fiquitiva](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva) as a template base.

## What's this?
This repository, Siru-Stuff, includes extra stuff that is needed and used for Siru Icon Pack to work properly. So, it's just a host for info, images, banners and wallpapers that will be showed across the app.
